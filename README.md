✏️ Customization Tips
Add more cards for new menu items

Customize button styles or add animations

Integrate with JavaScript or Firebase for real orders

Add a contact form or gallery section

This site uses media queries to adapt the layout on smaller screens:

Navbar collapses horizontally on mobile

Cards stack vertically for easier reading

Fonts and buttons shrink gracefully
